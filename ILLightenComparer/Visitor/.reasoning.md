# Design Solutions

1. Why not *dynamic*?

   * How to chain calls?
   * How make async call?

1. *TVisitor* can't be *IVisitor* becasue it forces implementation follow a call signature:

    ``` c#
    _autoVisitor.Accept(member, _visitor, il);
    ```

     Class of *_visitor* will have to implement method that depends on type of *method* parameter.

1. *AutoVisitor* don't depend on *IVisitor* to be able to name the *Visit* method differently. *AutoVisitor* uses duck typing, thus methods must follow signature of *IVisitor*.

1. Generated static method can not use actual types for parameters, because a call could be done with more generic (abstract) types.

1. Delegates cache keys should be based on types of calling arguments, becase we need to cast cached delegate to *Func<TVisitor, TAcceptor, TState, TState>*. Caching with actual types will store only one delegate type. And it could be not compatible with next call. Moreover, the signature of generated method should match calling signature. As we cache this method, cache key must follow it.
