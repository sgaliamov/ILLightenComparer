# ILLightenComparer

## To do

- [ ] basic implementation
- [ ] benchmarks
- [ ] optimization for integral types
- [ ] implementation for generics
- [ ] test when abstract class is replaced after a comparer is created
- [ ] customization setting to override comparer with specific implementation
- [ ] detect cycles (check graph theory)
- [ ] string options (case, culture)
- [ ] compare nullable
- [ ] compare object
- [ ] float, double, date time precision
- [ ] compare collection, do not iterate IEnumerable
- [ ] IgnoreCollectionOrder
- [ ] CompareFields
- [ ] Caching for assembly
- [ ] ignored properties
- [ ] compared dynamic?
- [ ] try DefineGlobalMethod instead DynamicMethod
- [ ] setup CI/CD
